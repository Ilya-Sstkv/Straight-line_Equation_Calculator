Console application that creates a specified number of points in 2D space and then calculates if there are any straight lines between these points.
Points' coordinates are stored in the HashMap (which is not necessary, but was required by the task).

Console shows the coordinates of each point and equations of straight lines found between two or more points (avoiding obvious repeats such as 1-2 and 2-1).
However, non-obvious repeats can still be output to the console. In this case, such equations will be marked as "repeated".

Information about all straight lines, including the points they pass through and their equations, is written into the file 'lineinfo.txt' without repeats.
The straight-line equations are written into the file in descending order of the number of points through which the line passes.

The application is written on Java. Interface language - Russian.
